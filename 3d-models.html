										<h2><a href="#">3D models</a></h2>
										<p>
											Below, you can read about the story of some of my 3D models.
										</p>
									</header>

									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/simple-city-1">CityScape</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											The Cityscape is made for my IST project. It is designed to be imported into Unity. It was originally meant to be textured
											but I decided to not put in the effort because unity doesn't import Blender textures natively. <br>
											
											There are a few duplicate buildings simply because I have ran out of ideas. This is a pretty rough city as houses goes through floors, street lamps are not aligned
											because I ran out of time. This city was made over two weekends making smaller buildings first before moving to sky scrapers.
										</p>

									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/detailed-willy-s-jeep-1">Detailed Jeep</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This Jeep was made of a history presentation last year. It is designed to be animated and the different parts of the jeep
											are meant to be showcased. This presentation never happened as ideas changed. This model took two weeks to make and it is the
											model I speant the most amount of time on so far. It is the most detailed of my projects but there are still some niggles.
											The front grill has some problems and most components of the chassis are missing but development slowed down after learning
											 the presentation was not going to happen.
										</p>
									</section>
									
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/simple-speaker-1">Simple Speaker</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											
											This speaker took around 30 minutes to make. It was basically used to experiment with image textures. It was mainly for fun
											and didn't offer much challenge.
										</p>
									</section>
									
									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/tux-2">Tux</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This model was made for my multimedia project. It does not really look like Tux but I tried. I don't really know why but since the project 
											is consided to be finished. The main problem was the feet where I can't get the toes to be more rounded and the proportions not being correct. 
										</p>
									</section>

									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/blender-logo-1">Blender Logo</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This is the blender logo I tried to make. It really didn't have much of a purpose. The fins that stretch out
											from the logo were the main challenge points. The fins aren't wide enough and I stuggled to get them to be even with each other
											and for them to be the same angle.
										</p>

											<h3>Space Ships</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Link 1: https://grabcad.com/library/space-ship-4 <br>
											Link 2: https://grabcad.com/library/space-ship-3 <br>
											These ships were made for a multimedia project last year. It was designed to be used in a trailer for a movie. These models are not detailed and are not
											perfect but I was pretty pleased with them at that time. It might be of some use to someone later though.
										</p>

									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/co2-car-3">CO2 Car</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This was a prototype CO2 car for the competition. It was not used because it broke every rule possible. Still, it was a good concept-the front splitter
											was designed to direct the air into the wheels which are shaped like a fan to keep the speed. There are many things missing from this model including wheels, 
											axle, and a canister holder.
										</p>

									<section>
										<header>
											<h3 href="https://grabcad.com/library/basic-car-2">Basic Car</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This is a basic car made following a tutorial from youtube. It does not look that good but I leant proportional editing as well as loopcuts in that tutorial.
											It can still serve as a template for the other cars I might make.

											<h3>Tutor4U Tutorial Projects</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Tea cup: https://grabcad.com/library/tea-cup-15 <br>
											Teddy bear: https://grabcad.com/library/teddy-bear-6 <br>
											Soccer ball: https://grabcad.com/library/soccer-ball-35 <br>
											Pool balls: https://grabcad.com/library/pool-balls-1 <br>
											Napkin in cup: https://grabcad.com/library/napkin-in-cup-1 <br>
											
											These models are made from tutorials by tutor4u. I have found these tutorials to be the easiest to follow and understand. These were the first projects I have made
											when I started using Blender in 2014.

											<h3>Bathroom Fixtures.</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Modern tap and vanity: https://grabcad.com/library/modern-tap-and-vanity-1 <br>
											Free Standing Bath: https://grabcad.com/library/free-standing-bath-1 <br>
											Shower compartment with rain shower: https://grabcad.com/library/shower-compartment-with-rain-shower-head-and-hand-held-1 <br>
											
											These fixtures are made for the current architecture project. They are designed to be modern and simple. The most difficult of these three projects
											is the free standing bath. This bath still doesn't look right. The model is not smooth enough is not proportional to a normal free standing bath. Hopefully, 
											people won't notice the flaws in the show case.

											<h3>Office Furniture</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											Study table: https://grabcad.com/library/study-table-9 <br>
											Office Chair: https://grabcad.com/library/office-chair-35 <br>
											Book shelf: https://grabcad.com/library/book-shelf-8 <br>
											
											These models are made for the current architecture project. They are designed to be modern and simple. The office chair took the longest time to make. 
											The cushion is still not detailed but is good enough to be put into the house. The bookshelf is the one that needs the most improvement in my opinion. 
											It looks okay but the fit and finish needs to be fixed.
