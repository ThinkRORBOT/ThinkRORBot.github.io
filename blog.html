											<h3>Creation of Website</h3>
										</header>
										<p>
											This post will go through the process of creating the ThinkRoRBot site.


I had been toying with the website of a personal website for a while before I created it. I learned html and css at the end of 2014 but I had no way to host the website. I wished to host my own website using a personal server but that would be far too complex. Hosting a DNS, an ftp server + learning to code will be far too much effort for what it's worth. I didn't want to use a website creator either as I feel it wouldn't allow enough flexibility and personalisation for what I want.


In August 2015, I found that github can be used as a website hosting service so I got into making a website. I tried to create a website from scratch using html/css but I soon found that the vastness of the project will be immense. For the website to look modern and act interactively with the viewer, I will also need to learn javascript. I decided to use a template from html5up. This is a fantastic website filled with modern, responsive and expansible templates for free. I proceeded to adjust the template so it will suit my needs.



Adjusting the website to my needs was not too difficult. I replaced all of the images with the ones of my own and changed the contents and formatting quite a bit. I will also add a few new pages in the future. There are some components of the website of which I needed outside help with. First is the base of the website which is from html5up. I also needed a contact form from smartaddon.com as well as a blog hosting service from blogger. There will be some blog posts on my website but Blogger is a more powerful and convenient service. I may expand the blogging features of my website further in the future.


The website is designed as a central hub for all my projects. It has various links to GrabCad- model hosting service, Flickr- Photography hosting service, Github-Code hosting service, CodeAbbey - programming challenges. It will hopefully be worked on and updated regularly although it may be disregarded due to other projects taking over. The links it provides though, will be current.
